Snowmobile Helmet: Good choice! The correct helmet is one that not only protects the head but provides adequate face covering.
Beanie: In case of a crash, something durable for head protection is needed.
ATV Helmet: This helmet could be good protection, but needs some goggles to shield the eyes, and a face covering.
Bike Helmet: Bike helmets protect the head, but not the face or eyes. It also doesn't help keep you warm!
Jeans: You may be able to walk around in the winter with these clothes, but they do not protect against the harsh conditions on a snowmobile.
Full Jacket: Nice! This clothing can also be used for skiing, and is still safe for snowmobiling, since it is waterproof and wind-resistant.
Full Snow Jacket: Nice! The outside of your snowmobile suit should always be waterproof and resistant to wind.
Shirt: Even if a snowmobile could drive on the beach, this is still not a safe option.
Fingerless Gloves: You have control of your fingers, but these gloves are not waterproof or cold-resistant enough.
Padded Gloves: Correct! These gloves allow your fingers to move separately, which is essential. They are also fully covered to prevent injury, and waterproof.
Biker Gloves: Gloves with open fingers don't protect your hands well enough from possible injuries.
Mittens: It would be pretty hard to operate a snowmobile with all your fingers stuck together! Moving them separately is important.
Snow Boots: Good job! Make sure to wear boots that are both waterproof and insulated.
Fluffy Boots: Boots like these aren't water resistant, and could get soaked!
Sneakers: Sneakers aren't quite enough to resist the snow and cold.
Flip Flops: These might end up flying off!
